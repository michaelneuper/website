### Basic
**Operating system:**
I use [arch](https://archlinux.org/), btw.

**Terminal:**
I use [alactritty](https://alacritty.org/) as my main terminal. I am thinking of switching to [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) but the speed of alacritty just can't be beaten.

**Shell:**
I use [fish](https://fishshell.com/) as my internactive shell and bash as the system shell.

**Window manager:**
[bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm)

**Text editor/IDE:**
I use a distribution of emacs called [doom-emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs). 
If I'm just quickly editing someting in the terminal like a config file I'll just use vi/vim, no need to pull up emacs for that.

### Utilities
**File manager:**
I use a file manger less and less nowadays and just do everything from the terminal. 
If I do need a GUI file manger for some reason I use [Nemo](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Nemo).
I've tried others like PCManFM but Nemo has the best search functionality hands down.

**Web browser:**
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), obviously.

**Mail client:**
I started to use the built in email client in emacs more but otherwise I use [mailspring](https://getmailspring.com/).

**Video player:**
Used to use vlc, now I use mpv like all the cool kids.

**Torrent client:**
[qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/).

### Production
*Video and audio:*
I use [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) to record video and [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) to edit videos.

*Digital Art:*
Been getting into digital art lately and have been loving [krita](https://krita.org/en/).

*Writing documents:*
Basic documents I write in markdown and more advanced stuff I write in LaTeX and compile to pdf. Emacs is also great for editing LaTeX docs, especially with live-latex-preview.

*Office suite:*
[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/). I pretty much only use an office suite for the spreadsheet program and sometimes the presentation program but I use org-mode in emacs for that now, still looking for a better way to do spreadsheets so I don't need an entire office suite just to make spreadsheets.

*PDF viewer:*
[zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/)

*Image modification:*
[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)
