Welcome to my comprehensive guide on the best Firefox extensions to supercharge your browsing experience!
As one of the most popular web browsers, Firefox offers a remarkable level of flexibility and customization through its vast extension ecosystem.
These extensions are like small add-ons that can enhance various aspects of your browsing, ranging from productivity and privacy to aesthetics and tailored experiences on platforms like YouTube and Reddit.

## Productivity

### [Tree Style Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/)
This extension provides the ability to work with tabs as "trees".

New tabs opened from the current tab are automatically organized as "children" of the current tab.
Such "branches" are easily folded (collapsed) by clicking on the arrow shown in the "parent" tab, so you no longer need to suffer from too many visible tabs.
If you want, you can restructure the tree via drag and drop.

### [Simple Tab Groups](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/simple-tab-groups/)
Simple Tab Groups works across browser instances/windows too. 
If you select a group in another window, the selected window will jump to the foreground with the chosen group selected. You can even select the specific tab within that group in background browser windows.

### [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/)
The Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension lets you carve out a separate box for each of your online lives – no more opening a different browser just to check your work email!

### [DownThemAll!](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/)
DownThemAll will help you select, queue, sort and run your downloads faster.
It comes with advanced ways to select what links to download, and will remember your previous decisions so that you can queue more downloads with just One Click!

Advanced users will also like using renaming masks, which let you automatically assign names (and even sub-folders within your downloads folder), fast-filtering or even custom, re-usable filters.

## Quality of Life

### [Auto Tab Discard](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/auto-tab-discard/)

### [I don't care about cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/istilldontcareaboutcookies/)
The EU regulations require that any website using tracking cookies must get user's permission before installing them.
These warnings appear on most websites until the visitor agrees with the website's terms and conditions.
Imagine how irritating that becomes when you surf anonymously or if you delete cookies automatically every time you close the browser.

This add-on will remove these cookie warnings from almost all websites! You can report any website which still warns you about cookies: just click 'Report a cookie warning' from the extension menu (the brown cookie image next to your address bar).

In most cases, the add-on just blocks or hides cookie related pop-ups.
When it's needed for the website to work properly, it will automatically accept the cookie policy for you (sometimes it will accept all and sometimes only necessary cookie categories, depending on what's easier to do).
It doesn't delete cookies.

## Aesthetics

### [Dark Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/)
This eye-care extension enables night mode creating dark themes for websites on the fly.
Dark Reader inverts bright colors making them high contrast and easy to read at night.

You can adjust brightness, contrast, sepia filter, dark mode, font settings and ignore-list.
