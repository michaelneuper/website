In today's fast-paced world, finding time to read can be challenging. 
However, reading provides numerous benefits, such as boosting mental stimulation, reducing stress, and expanding our knowledge. 
If you've been struggling to incorporate more reading into your life, don't worry – you're not alone. 
In this blog post, we'll explore some easy and effective strategies to help you read more and enjoy the process.

# Set Small, Achievable Goals

When setting reading goals, it's crucial to avoid overwhelming yourself with unrealistic expectations. 
Large goals, like reading for 30 minutes every day, can be challenging to maintain consistently. 
Once we fail to meet such a goal, it can quickly spiral into a habit of not reading at all. 
To counteract this, establish micro-goals that are almost impossible to miss, such as reading just one page a day. 
This achievable target ensures you never fall into the habit of skipping your daily reading, and more often than not, you'll find yourself exceeding the goal and reading even more. By focusing on micro-goals, you build a sustainable reading habit that becomes second nature.

# Focus on the Chapters That Intrigue You

This tip is particularly relevant for non-fiction books, such as popular science titles, but can apply to other genres as well. 
When diving into a book, you may find that only certain chapters capture your interest. 
Instead of forcing yourself to read every single page, feel empowered to focus on the sections that truly engage you. 
This approach maximizes your enjoyment and allows you to extract the most valuable information from the book.

And yes, even if you haven't read every chapter, you can still claim that you've read the book. 
After all, reading is a personal journey, and there's no rule stating that you must consume every word from cover to cover. 
Embrace a tailored reading experience that caters to your interests and curiosity.

# Embrace the Art of Moving On

It's common to feel obliged to finish a book, especially if we've invested money in purchasing it. 
This sense of obligation can sometimes lead us to stop reading altogether when we're struggling with an uninteresting book. 
It's important to recognize this as the sunk cost fallacy – the misconception that we must continue an activity because of the resources we've already spent on it.

To break free from this mindset, give yourself permission to move on from a book that isn't enjoyable. 
Remember, reading is meant to be a pleasurable experience that enriches our lives, not a burdensome obligation. 
By letting go of books that don't engage you, you create space for discovering new, captivating stories that reignite your passion for reading. 
Don't let the sunk cost fallacy dictate your reading habits – embrace the freedom to explore new literary worlds without guilt.

# Read Multiple Books at Once

Our mood and energy levels can significantly influence our reading preferences. 
Sometimes, we might be in the midst of a complex book, such as Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, which requires substantial thought and concentration. 
However, after a long day at work or school, we might crave something lighter and more accessible.

To ensure that your reading doesn't come to a halt due to mood fluctuations, keep a selection of books on hand that cater to different mental states and preferences. 
This approach allows you to switch between books depending on your mood and energy levels, ensuring that you always have something enjoyable to read. 
By maintaining a diverse reading list, you'll keep the momentum going and continue to reap the benefits of reading, no matter how you're feeling.
