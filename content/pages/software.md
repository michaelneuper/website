## Basic
**Operating system:**
I use [arch](https://archlinux.org/), btw.

**Terminal:**
[Alactritty](https://alacritty.org/) on desktop and [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) on mac.
Nowadays I mostly use vterm or eshell in emacs.

**Shell:**
[fish](https://fishshell.com/) on Linux and zsh on macOS and eshell emacs.

**Window manager:**
[bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) on Linux and [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) on macOS.

**Text editor/IDE:**
[GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with the [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) configuration framework. 

## Utilities
**File manager:**
I do 99% of my file management with dired inside emacs. 
For the other 1% I'll use the default file manager.

**Web browser:**
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), obviously.

**Mail client:**
I started to use [mu4e](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/mu4e) in emacs more but otherwise I use [mailspring](https://getmailspring.com/).

**Video player:**
Used to use vlc, now I use mpv like all the cool kids.

**Torrent client:**
[qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) on Linux and [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) on macOS.

## Production
**Digital Art:**
Been getting into digital art lately and have been loving [krita](https://krita.org/en/).

**Writing documents:**
I write almost everything [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/) and I'll export to LaTeX occasionally.
Professional documents I write directly in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).

**Office suite:**
[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/).
Don't really use an office suite since I write documents and slideshows in org mode and LaTeX.

**PDF viewer:**
I used to use [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) but now I use pdf-tools inside Emacs.

**Image modification:**
[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)
